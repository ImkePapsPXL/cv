        <h1>Development</h1>
        <h2>Why programming?</h2>
        <h3>Why the education programming?</h3>
        <p>I love coding. I started an evening education while I was still working on webdesign and grafics design.
        Here I noticed how much I like to create. Creativity, curiosity and creating something new has always been inside me.
        I did not find fullness and satisfaction in my jobs so far, but the evening education did. This is how I figured out what
        I want to do and what I enjoy. So I decided to pursue this. of course the previous jobs are no loss, I learned a lot of hard
        and soft skills and learned what I need in a job. I know for a fact I like having good colleagues u can work with,
        but also being independent. Clear expectations is something I need, other than that I can make my own plans and work independently.
        Good and honest communication is very important to me.</p>
        <h3>Why I believe this job is right for me?</h3>
        <p>As I said before, I love creating. I am independent enough to solve problems myself and I enjoy finding solutions to problems and
        make a beautifull result that makes people happy. I can go hours working on code. Once I am focussed it is hard to break and I keep going
        until I am satisfied. Seeing the program or website change and do what u like after some hard work puts a smile on my face.
        With this kind of job my creativity can be let loose on the job. This is something I desperately missed in the past jobs.</p>
